What determines uniqueness?

Library:
  id serial NOT NULL,
  idofparent integer,
  name character varying(255) NOT NULL,
  isroot boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  isleaf boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  created_at timestamp without time zone,
  updated_at timestamp without time zone,
  CONSTRAINT libraries_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
  
  Name

Library File Specs:
  id serial NOT NULL,
  idoflibraryrecord integer,
  filesizeinmb integer,
  artist character varying(255),
  album character varying(255),
  length numeric,
  created_at timestamp without time zone,
  updated_at timestamp without time zone,
  comment character varying(255),
  genre character varying(255),
  title character varying(255),
  track character varying(255),
  year character varying(255),
  bitrate integer,
  channels integer,
  
  Levels?
  Level  1 
  Level  2
  Level  3
  Level  4
  Level  5
  ...
  
  Level 10 - Everything matches including filename, parent directory and size
  What does the model look like?  
  
  1.  the title has to match... if the titles are different, then expect it to be different  (what about those with no title?)
      what about the opposite? Can I have two titles that are different, but the same resource?
  2.  artist (same artist same title on different albums)
  3.  album
  4.  track
  5.  year
  6.  length
  7.  filesize
  8.  parent directory
  
  
  Selection
  Higher bitrate?
  Higher channels?

Here's the selection for the track into the master library:  
with max_bitrate as (select max(bitrate) bitrate from library_file_specs where artist = 'Torcuato Mariano' and album = 'Last Look' and title = 'Africa'),
     best_file_extension as (select extension, max_bitrate.bitrate bitrate from file_extensions, max_bitrate where sort_order = (select min(sort_order) from file_extensions where extension in (select file_extension from library_file_specs lfs where artist = 'Torcuato Mariano' and album = 'Last Look' and title = 'Africa' and lfs.bitrate = max_bitrate.bitrate)))
select id, lfs.bitrate, file_extension
from library_file_specs lfs--, max_bitrate, best_file_extension
where artist = 'Torcuato Mariano'
and album = 'Last Look'
and title = 'Africa'
--and lfs.bitrate = max_bitrate.bitrate
--and lfs.file_extension = best_file_extension.extension
and lfs.id in (
	select min(id)
	from library_file_specs lfs, best_file_extension
	where artist = 'Torcuato Mariano' and album = 'Last Look' and title = 'Africa'
	and (lfs.file_extension,lfs.bitrate) = (best_file_extension.extension, best_file_extension.bitrate)
)
