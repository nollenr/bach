M4P stands for MPEG 4 Protected (audio). 
  The M4P file extension is seen in an Apple iTunes purchased song which uses 
  Apples “Fairplay” DRM (digital rights management). Unprotected AAC files have
  an M4A extension.

MP3 stands for MPEG Audio Layer-3
  The MPEG compression system includes a subsystem to compress sound, called MPEG
  Audio Layer-3. We know it by its abbreviation, MP3. MP3 can compress a song by
  a factor of 10 or 12 and still retain something close to CD quality. So a 
  30-megabyte sound file from a CD reduces to 3 megabytes or so in MP3.
  
M4A is a file extension for an audio file encoded with advanced audio coding
(AAC) which is a lossy compression. 
  M4A was generally intended as the successor to MP3, which had not been
  originally designed for audio only but was layer III in an MPEG 1 or 2 video
  files.
