Date        Version     Notes
20140908    v0.1        Create a method to return the extension or nil if there is not one.
20141015    v0.1        Change LibraryFileSpec model.  Track should be an integer, not character varying.
20141015    v0.1        Change LibraryFileSpec model.  Add file extension (or file type?). 
20141015    v0.1        Change code to add file_extension to LibraryFileSpec.
20141015    v0.1        Added the model LibraryRoot.  This is the top level directory structure
			of a music library and also contains a priority which will be used to 
			select a single track where there exists multiple.
20141016    v0.1        Added "library_priority" to LibraryFileSpec.
20141016    v0.1        Change code to include "Priority" on LibraryFileSpec
20141017    v0.1        Check to be sure all of the titles in the library are in the master library
20141021    v0.1        Changed logic for m_process_dir.  No longer does a chdir; instead also passes the
			path as part of the definition.
20141021    v0.1        Included "ismaster" on LibraryRoot and Library.  
20141022    v0.1        Remove "ismaster" from everywhere since master will not be in LibraryRoot
20141022    v0.1        m_create_physical_master is not copying any tracks with null (artist-album-title)
                        Am I going to put them all in one container (directory) on disk?  What if there is a collision
                        in file names?  For now, they're all going in differenct directories.
20141022    v0.1        Remove "newlibraryrec" from Library.  Change code in m_create_or_updateMaster_library
                        as well as m_process_dir.  
Cancel                  Include update logic for MasterLibraryFile (currently, the method only creates new records).
                        This is now crosscheck-master
Cancel                  Include logic to sync master library with what is currently sitting on disk.
                        This is now crosscheck-master
20141024    v0.2        During a crosscheck-master, if I find someting missing on disk, but it still exists
                        in the library, copy it over.  Split into 2.  crosscheck-master is complete, but it 
                        does not do any copying, instead it logs a message for the user to take action.  New
                        todo to make the copying automatic.
20141024    v0.2        During the crosscheck-master, if I find something new on disk, and it's not in the
                        master library, copy it over to one of the 'libraries'.  But... first, check to be 
                        sure it's not already in one of the libraries, right?
20141024    v0.2        Add newlibraryrec to MasterLibraryFile and include in create_or_update_master_library
                        (to set it -- defautl is true, I don't think I need to set it) and in 
                        create_phyiscal_master (to select by it and update it to false).
20141024                Merge to master.
20141027    v0.3        Crosscheck-itunes
                        Put iTunes in the Library (m_process_libraries)
                        Put iTunes files in the LibraryFileSpecs (m_process_file_specs)
                        Check for anything in LFS that IS itunes that doesn't exist in another
			Library (except for master)
20141028    v0.3        Delete itunes library info.  Delete from LFS/Library.
20141029    v0.3        m_crosscheck_libraries - be sure it isn't picking up itunes nor master
                        libraries when checking to see if something is missing.
20141029    v0.3        m_prune_tree log doesn't have a run id assoicated with it.
20141029    v0.3        m_process_file_specs will now create log entries if it is being run
                        in "udpate mode" -- which is triggered by sending a "true" into the
                        method when it is called.  False is the default.
20141029    v0.3        m_create_physical_master logs updates.
20141030    classify    Make all methods loadable and then executable (no execute on load)

TODO:
Priority                Task
In Process              Error logging and messages
Low                     Include library priority when selecting a track 
Low                     During crosscheck-master, if something is missing on disk, copy from a library if
                        if it exists.
Low                     During crosscheck-master, if there's something new on disk, copy to a library
                        so that it will be picked up during a crosscheck-library.  It will eventually
                        get cleaned up in the master library on disk when a complete refresh is run.
Meduim			Change all logging.  I should be able to get the process name automatically
                        by sending in the name of the method which is currently executing.  Is this
			what I want, tho?
High			Create foreign keys for the MasterLibraryFile-PlaylistSongs-Playlist models.
High                    Playlist name not null.


Three Choices For Music Libraries:
--------------------------------------
The problem - iTunes library has a lot of stuff in it (podcasts, apps, along with other sundry items).  The
              goal is to only include music and audio book items... stuff that I might have on a CD.  This 
              might need to be expanded to include vidoe in the future, but for now, I'm concerned about
              music type items.
Choice 1      Only mount directories that are music related.  The drawback is that I _might_ miss something, 
              or not see it.
Choice 2      Mount all directories, but only include directories that have music (LibraryRoot.create)
Choice 3      Mount all directories, and use a flag on Library to choose which sub-levels to include
              in the depth-sweep.  
For now, going with choice 2.
What I would like is choice 3, with an expanding list (like winery location  - us/california/sanoma/)


Synching The Master Table with the Master Library
-------------------------------------------------
 1. What if the master table is empty - but the master library is not empty?  
 	Then this would seem to be same as a file in the master library not in 
 	the master table.
 2.	Master Library Empty - but the master table is not empty
 	Then this would seem to be the same as a record in the master table
 	that needs to be synched to the master library
 3. Both Empty
 	Same as a new, "fresh" system.  This is already working.
 4.	Files in Master Library - Not in Master Table
 	The master table needs to be updated.
 	Is the file in the library tables?  
 	Does it need to be copied over and put into the library and then
 	added to the master?  No.  Can't the master be a "library" on it's own?
 	Nope.  The master isn't a library... it's for iTunes only.  iTunes
 	may mangle the master library.  Don't count on it being a "gold" standard.
 5.	Files in the Master Table - Not in the Master Library
 	This would seem to be a sub case of a Master Library Populate.  


Postgres Recursive Query
--------------------------
WITH RECURSIVE t(parentid, path) AS  -- create a temp table named t
(
    SELECT idofparent, name from libraries where id = 3243     -- non-recursive term
  UNION ALL
    SELECT idofparent, CAST(libraries.name||'/'||t.path as varchar(255)) FROM libraries,t where libraries.id = t.parentid     -- recursive term
)
SELECT * from t
